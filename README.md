   - Name: `GROQ_API_KEY`
   - Value: Your Groq API key from [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)

### 2. Add to Your Website

Add this code to your website before the closing `</body>` tag:

<!-- Groq Website Assistant --> <script src="https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/src/chat-widget.js"></script> <script> initGroqAssistant({ apiEndpoint: 'https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/api/chat', companyName: 'Your Company', welcomeMessage: 'Hello!

text

That's it! The chat widget will appear on your website.

## Customization Options

You can customize the assistant with these options:

initGroqAssistant({
// Required
apiEndpoint: 'https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/api/chat',

// Content
companyName: 'Your Company',
welcomeMessage: 'Hello! How can I help you today?',

systemPrompt: `You are the AI sales assistant for [Company Name].

[Product name]: [Brief description]

Key benefits: [List main benefits]

Pricing: [Price information]

Sales directives:

Recommend relevant products

Address objections with specific benefits

Guide users toward making a purchase

When users ask about purchasing, include this exact link:
https://your-website.com/order

Your job is to be helpful, informative, and gently persuasive.`

text

### Alternate Models

- `llama-3.1-8b-instant`: Faster responses, good for most cases
